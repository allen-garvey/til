# How to install Schalbe Marathon Plus tires

## Tools required

* Bike tire lever (to remove tire)
* Bike pump
* Thin flathead screwdriver

## Instructions

* Inflate the tube just enough to maintain its shape and put it inside the tire
* Put one side of the tire inside the rim, and put the inflation tube through the hole
* Hold the tire and the rim in one hand, by wrapping your fingers around both the tire and rim, like you were going to carry it
* While holding it in one hand as described above, use your other hand to start putting the other side of the tire into the rim, just enough so that it stays inside the rim on its own
* Using both hands (thumbs), push the second side of the tire into the rim, until you can't anymore (roughly 5-6 spokes of tire will remain to be put inside the rim). Push down on the tire, and massage the slack to the edges to create slack to do this.
* Find a thin flathead screwdriver and insert it at the edge of where the tire meets the rim. The handle of the screwdriver should be pointing down towards the center of the tire. Push the screwdriver so its handle is pointing up towards the edge of the tire, this should work as a lever to put the tire into the rim
